# PowerShell.ProfileFX
This Repository contains each of my own Personal PowerShell Profiles, spanning various Hosts, including ISE, VSCode, PowerGUI, and PowerShellPlus (yes, I STILL use both of these tools to this day, despite both having been phased out quite some time ago), with each Profile/set of Profiles stored in a Directory and/or otherwise clearly marked so as to ensure there is no confusion as to which Profiles correspond to which PSEdition/Host/Scope. Also included within are a handful of Utilities, including my main Profile Module containing Commands, Aliases, Variables, etc. for my Profile(s), which is, itself, constructed out of several smaller 'components' or Plugin Modules, each geared toward a different specialized task/scenario/purpose. Finally, in the '.config' folder you will find an assortment of Configuration files. These range from ConsoleUI Settings, which stores values to be assigned to the ConsoleColor and UI Settings stored in '$Host.UI.RawUI' and '$Host.PrivateData', a PSReadline Settings file, etc. as well as my default 'Settings.json', 'Tasks.json', 'Keybindings.json', etc. for VSCode, and my 'Settings.json' file I use for WIndows Terminal Preview including all my Custom Color Schemes. You'll also find in the 'Extras' folder, a collection of little bonuses that didn't seem to fit in anywhere else.
